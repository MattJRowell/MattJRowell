- 👋 Hi, I’m @MattJRowell, but you can call me Matt!
  
- 👀 I’m interested in how systems function behind the scenes. My background is in filmmaking, visual effects, and game design, so I'm particularly interested in that sort of stuff.
  
- 🧠 I love learning new skills, hence why I have started to dip my toes into software engineering and development.
  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, Databases, and Web Applications, as well as other tools used in developing great games (such as Unreal Engine, Blender, and Ren'Py).
  
- 💻 I am currently a DevOps Engineering apprentice at Apple.
  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that might help me stretch my coding legs further!
  
- 📫 How to reach me: I'm on Linked in at www.linkedin.com/in/mattrowell12

- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm an aspiring author, with a text-based adventure and visual novel in the works.
